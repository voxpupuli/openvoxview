# Development

OpenVoxView has two components, a small golang backend and a Vue 3 (Quasar) frontend.

## Requirements
- golang >= 1.23
- yarn
- node >=20 <=24

## Prerequisite (OpenVoxDB)

You can connect directly to an OpenVoxDB if you can access one, 
but for local development the recommendation is using [Crafty](https://github.com/voxpupuli/crafty)

## Frontend development
you can execute `make develop-frontend` it will execute following steps:

```
cd ui
yarn install
yarn build
VUE_APP_BACKEND_BASE_ADDRESS=http://localhost:5000 yarn dev
```

**VUE_APP_BACKEND_BASE_ADDRESS** is an environment variable which points to the backend for the development. 
in production this will be automatically shipped by the backend


## Backend development

For backend development you can use your favorite golang development environment and 
start directly with the development.

You need to have the ui/dist/spa folder, it can be generated by build the frontend or it can be empty:
`mkdir -p ui/dist/spa`

for settings see [CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md)


# Releases
For releases currently it only needs a git tag
